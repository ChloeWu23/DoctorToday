The AIDS syndrome which occurs in up to 50% of carriers may not appear until many years later when the destruction of the immune response leads to progressive inability to fight infections, wasting and certain cancers. Usually an HIV carrier will remain infective in spite of not having the overt signs of AIDS - you cannot tell if someone is an HIV carrier just by looking at them.</p><p>Prevention is the best strategy (safe sex, avoid sharing needles) since there is at present no effective vaccine. For those infected with HIV, cure is problematic. Modern therapy can do much to improve quality of life and to reduce viral load and infectivity, however, so the sooner the treatment is started the better.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>HIV Testing at Doctor Today</strong></h3><p>The test used at Doctor Today to diagnose HIV infection is called the HIV-DUO. This costs \u00a3100 inclusive of a sexual health consultation and tests for both HIV 1&amp;2 antibodies (formed in reaction to the virus) and the p24 antigen (part of the virus itself) for earlier diagnosis. Results for this test are usually available within one working day (usually on the same day for those with weekday appointments before 2pm, and by 11am the next business day morning for those with appointments between 2pm and 8pm). This test will usually become positive from 4 weeks after the contact which causes infection. For confirmation purposes, a second test at 3 to 6 months is advised if the initial test is negative. If both are negative, you can be very sure (99.99%) you are not infected with the HIV virus (this is of course provided no further contacts occur in the meantime; you are advised to maintain a policy of safe sex during this period). If earlier diagnosis is required, the HIV-1 proviral DNA by PCR test can be done from day 10 to 14 post-contact, but is more expensive; in addition, not only do results take longer (several days), but the test is also not quite as general as the DUO as it applies only to HIV-1 infections (the normal type). HIV-2 infection is more common in West African countries and if your contact may have been in this area, you should back up the HIV-1 proviral DNA test with a DUO test at 4 weeks.</p><p>If your initial test is positive, we perform further confirmatory tests for you free of charge. This consists of three divergent methodologies to cross-check the positive result, as clearly a firm and accurate diagnosis is of the utmost importance. If a positive result is confirmed, we are able to advise you appropriately and to refer you to a specialist clinic for further management.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Why we do not use \"instant\" HIV Tests</strong></h3><p>The directors of Doctor Today have taken the view that so-called \"instant\" HIV testing by the INSTI or other point of care method will not be offered at this time to our patients for the following reasons:</p><p>In areas of low HIV prevalence such as UK, 6 out of every 7 positive instant tests are in fact likely to turn out to be negative, so patients may be given unnecessary anxiety for no good reason.</p><ul><li>There is also a small but appreciable false negative rate with instant tests (i.e. test shows negative but in fact the patient is positive), which could be disastrous for the patient and their partners if the instant test is relied upon.</li><li>An instant test is not a lot cheaper (at our clinic) than the HIV-DUO test. Any positive test would have to be followed up with by confirmatory testing which is more sensitive, so the cost of this would have to be extra. In our clinic the confirmatory testing after a positive HIV-DUO test is done free of charge to the patient. This can be very expensive if it is done separately and is something you need to take into account when choosing where to have your test done.</li><li>The instant test turns positive some time after the HIV-DUO test is positive (i.e. there is a longer \"window period\").</li><li>There is no p24 antigen testing with the instant tests which is a big advantage of the HIV-DUO test, the results for which are usually back within one working day.</li></ul><p>For all the above reasons we feel the regular HIV-DUO test is still the most appropriate test for our patients, with the PCR test for those who feel they cannot wait.

The license approval covers use in children and adolescents aged 9 to 15 years and in adult females aged 16 to 26 years for the prevention of cervical cancer, high-grade cervical or vulvar dysplasias/ precancers as well as external genital warts (condylomata acuminate) caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18. These are the commonest (but not the only) viruses associated with cancer of the cervix which kills thousands of women in the UK every year. HPV vaccination provides the best protection against HPV infection that is available for persons having unprotected sexual intercourse with a previously infected partner. The results of the infection are not always obvious, so unless the two partners are both virgins or abstinence is complete, vaccination is advised. Vaccinated persons are NOT protected against other forms of sexually transmitted infection and barrier methods such as condoms are still advised for both heterosexual and homosexual intercourse.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Note that HPV vaccination does not eliminate the need for regular cervical smear checks as (a) the infection may have been already acquired, and (b) not all viruses causing cancer are covered. Protection against the 4 type of virus lasts for at least 5 years after completing the full course which consists of three doses by intramuscular injection in the upper arm - usually given at 0, 2 and 6 months. Alternative schedules are possible but it is recommended there should be at least 1 month between the first and the second dose, and at least 3 months between the second and the third, and all doses should be given within one year.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Potential Side Effects</strong></h3><p>Side effects are very uncommon as this is NOT a live vaccine; they usually consist of no more than some redness and soreness at the site of the injection which lasts a few days. Very occasionally an allergic reaction may follow such as hives or urticaria. However, HPV vaccine should NOT be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active substance or any of the other ingredients; if a patient shows signs of an allergy after a dose of the vaccine, (s)he should not receive further doses of the vaccine. Vaccination should be postponed in patients who are ill with a high fever, also patients who are pregnant, as safety in pregnancy has not been fully assessed; however, vaccination is not contraindicated in breast feeding women. The vaccine may be given with Hep B vaccines but has not been cleared for co-administration with other vaccines.</p><p>In patients who are HIV positive or immuno-compromised for other reasons (e.g. taking strong arthritis medications such as methotrexate), the normal immune reaction may not be sufficient to prevent subsequent infection in spite of a full course. So although immunisation is not contraindicated in such individuals, it is wise not to assume full protection and repeat courses may be necessary.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Pricing Information</strong></h3><p>Each Gardasil injection costs \u00a3180 per dose (normal course three doses at 0, 2 and 6 months). A pre-booked complete three-dose course is available at a discounted price of \u00a3499 (see our full price list).</p><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>Further Information</strong></h3><p>For further information about Gardasil, see the Gardasil patient information leaflet and the Electronic Medicines Compendium entry for Gardasil.</p><p>Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or wish to make an appointment.

Caused by the influenza virus, it usually is self-limiting and often follows a 9 day pattern (3 days getting worse, 3 days feeling terrible and 3 days getting better). It should not be confused with the common cold (runny nose, sneezing, feeling weak, mild fever less than 38C) (more information).</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">It is possible to improve immunity against the influenza virus by vaccination; antibiotics are generally useless in the early treatment of flu, though they may be useful if a secondary infection complicates recovery.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Influenza (flu) vaccinations at Doctor Today</strong></h3><p>The vaccine we use at Doctor Today is Inactivated Influenza Vaccine by Sanofi. Doses are supplied in prefilled (individual dose) syringes.</p><p><br></p><p>For your information:</p><ul><li>The product is made from viruses selected in the current year by the WHO (World Health Organisation) and CDC (Centre for Disease Control) which are grown in chicken eggs and then inactivated to ensure that transmission of the disease is impossible. IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO EGGS OR EGG PRODUCTS, THIS VACCINE IS NOT SUITABLE FOR YOU. If you cannot take the vaccine, you may wish to consider other preventative agents (such as amantadine or oseltamivir), but generally these medications are active only against influenza A and must be taken daily even when not ill.</li><li>This is not a live vaccine, so it can be given to pregnant women, children and immune-compromised persons (i.e. those who are suffering from other illnesses) without problem. All persons aged 65 or over, pregnant women or immune-compromised patients are advised to undergo vaccination.</li><li>Nearly all adult influenza vaccines contain trace amounts of a preservative to ensure freedom from contamination (more information). Our vaccine does not contain thiomersal. At present we do not have stocks of preservative-free vaccine. Some alternative preservative-free vaccines have had supply and safety problems recently.</li><li>Side effects of vaccination are generally mild: sometimes a feeling of soreness at the injection site for a few days, very occasionally a mild fever. Flu vaccination cannot give you 'flu!</li><li>Once given, immunity takes approximately two weeks to be sufficient to give good protection. It is important to realise that influenza vaccination does NOT prevent infection by the common cold; nor does it guarantee protection against all known strains of influenza. However, if you are immunised against influenza, and particularly if this is a yearly routine for you, if you do contract influenza of another sort (eg avian/bird flu, or a new influenza A) then it is believed you are less likely to suffer the severe symptoms which might occur if you get a dose of bird flu while you are low with ordinary flu.</li><li>There is no specific vaccine available in the UK for avian/bird flu at present. However, the WHO recommends influenza vaccination for persons at high risk of contracting this disease (more information).</li><li>Flu vaccination ideally needs to be done once a year every year as the virus continually changes its structure. As you build up immunity to more and more strains, the chances of getting a recurrent strain become reduced.</li><li>IF A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 12 YEARS HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN VACCINATED AGAINST FLU, A REPEAT DOSE IN 4 TO 6 WEEKS IS RECOMMENDED.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3><strong>General advice on avoiding infection with influenza and common cold viruses</strong></h3><ul><li>These viruses are sometimes transmitted through the air, which of course is difficult to avoid in confined spaces such as underground trains and buses. However a major method of transmission is by rubbing the nose or rubbing the eyes with hands that have touched something that has the virus on it. When a sufferer uses a tissue, the virus is automatically transferred to the hands that hold the tissue. Then the hand touches a stair rail, door handle or any other item around, and others touch the same handle, rub their nose or eyes and a new infection results. This is why children's nurseries are a very common place to pick up infection.</li><li>THEREFORE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN NOT GETTING INFECTED IS HAND HYGIENE AND MAKING SURE YOU NEVER TOUCH YOUR NOSE OR EYES WITH UNWASHED HANDS</li><li>Similarly if you have a cold and are sneezing or using toilet tissues, make sure these do not get damp, and wash your hands frequently. A good tip is to use an alcohol gel to rub on your hands after using tissues if you cannot get to a wash basin.</li><li>Attention to your general health and improving resistance with a good exercise, fresh air and healthy eating programme is helpful. Supplementation with zinc 15mg per day is thought to decrease the length of symptoms in recovery from the common cold.</li></ul><p>Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or wish to make an appointment.

Normally healthy subjects have good immunity to infection, but if resistance is lowered for any reason (prolonged stress, exposure to cold, age over 65 years, spleen removal or other illnesses affecting the immune system) infection may strike with devastating consequences - there is a 10% death rate in those who contract an infection if they are over 65 years old.</p><p><br></p><p>All persons over 65 years old should be vaccinated, and for this group this should be available free of charge through the NHS. It is often given at the same time as the flu jab, but can be also given at any other time if desired. Others we would recommend having the vaccine are those with chronic heart or lung disease, liver disease, alcoholism, spleen removal or diabetes mellitus. A single vaccination is all that is necessary, and immunity usually lasts a lifetime. It should NOT be repeated within 3 years as a marked reaction may follow, but in spleen removal patients it may be boosted at 5 years. We use the 23-valent vaccine (active immunity is developed against 23 varieties of the infective agent) for all persons over 2 years of age.

The rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline) is the only known way to protect children against the virus at present, offering a protection level of 85% for all Rotavirus disease and 100% for severe Rotavirus disease (more information).</span></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Optimal vaccination schedule</strong></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The optimal time to vaccinate a child with Rotarix is at 2 and 4 months when side effects have been shown to be no different to a placebo (sugar water) (more information). If the course is started after 5 months there is a very small increased risk (one in 12,000 using an earlier vaccine called Rotashield) of intussusception (a condition in which the bowel folds in on itself and may need hospital treatment). If you are considering protection for a child older than 4 months who has not had any diarrhoeal illness since birth because you are travelling abroad where medical resources are poor, you should discuss the risks with a clinician but generally this is not encouraged by the Department of Health in UK as the vaccine is not yet registered for this group.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Compatibility with other vaccines</strong></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Oral rotavirus vaccine can be given at the same time as the standard 5-in-1 diphtheria-tetanus-polio-Haemophilus influenzae type b and oral polio vaccine.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Further information</strong></h3><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or wish to make an appointment.

Licensure meant that the vaccine was authorised for use and governments could choose to implement it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why vaccinate?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>For decades, MenB has been the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in the UK and Ireland. Vaccines are the only way to prevent meningitis and have almost eliminated some other kinds of meningitis. Since the first meningitis vaccine was introduced against Hib meningitis in 1992, many kinds of meningitis have been reduced or have dwindled to a mere handful of cases, including Hib, MenC and pneumococcal. Thanks to meningitis vaccines, thousands of children are alive today who would otherwise have died from these deadly diseases.&nbsp;</p><p>Developing a MenB vaccine has been much more difficult \u2013 until now, protection against MenB has been a distant possibility. Meanwhile, meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia remain the leading infectious cause of death for children under five in the UK.&nbsp;</p><p>Doses:</p><p>More than one dose of the vaccine is needed for sufficient protection \u2013 the total number depends on the age of the person being vaccinated:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Children between 2-6 months of age need 4 doses.&nbsp;</li><li>Children between 6 months and 2 years of age need 3 doses.&nbsp;</li><li>Children over 2 and adults require 2 doses, but it has not yet been established whether a booster dose is needed to maintain protection in these age groups.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">The vaccine is not licensed for children under 8 weeks old because there is not enough information about how well the vaccine works in this age group.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Side effects:&nbsp;</p><p>As with all drugs, vaccines can cause side effects. Vaccine side effects may include soreness/redness/swelling or hardness of skin at the injection site, fever, lack of appetite, muscle aches, irritability, sleepiness and rashes.&nbsp;</p><p>Active ingredients in the vaccine:&nbsp;</p><p>The active ingredients that equip our immune system to fight MenB bacteria include four main components of meningococcal bacteria.&nbsp;</p><p>Three of them are proteins found on the surface of the bacteria:&nbsp;</p><p>Factor H Binding Protein (fHbp)&nbsp;</p><p>Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA)&nbsp;</p><p>Neisserial Adhesin A (NadA)&nbsp;</p><p>These three components help meningococcal bacteria invade and survive within the human body. In vaccinated people, the immune system can recognise and \u2018neutralise\u2019 these components, so the bacteria cannot make them ill.&nbsp;</p><p>The final ingredient is the New Zealand MenB Vaccine (MenZB) derived from the New Zealand outbreak strain of MenB (strain NZ 98/254).&nbsp;</p><p>All of these components have been processed and inactivated and are not part of any living bacteria, but can still stimulate the immune system.</p>", "price":"130 per dose", "createdAt":"2023-02-20 20:21:29", "updatedAt":"2023-02-20 20:21:29"},
