7,0,7,gp-consultations,Histofreeze consultation,"Removing a wart/verruca is a problem you may be able to solve yourself over the course of a few months using duct tape (available from hardware stores) (more information and instructions). However, if you would like an accelerated resolution of the problem, Doctor Today offers a cryotherapy service (i.e. freezing the wart/verruca using liquid nitrogen or similar cryogen).

Note that it is important to be sure that what you have is indeed a wart or verruca caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and not a skin growth or cancer which may need surgical or other treatment. If you are in doubt, or if you have tried the duct tape remedy and the wart or verruca is not going away as it should, please book a consultation and we will be happy to review it and at the same time carry out a review of your moles and other skin blemishes which may need attention. If cryotherapy is indicated, but the wart/verruca is not in an area amenable to this treatment, other methods may be needed -- we will be happy to help you choose the right one.

In terms of costs, we typically charge ?10 for the initial consultation; if necessary, subsequent sessions are ?5.
