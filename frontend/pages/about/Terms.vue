            <h2>Using our services</h2>
            <ol class="list-outside mx-6">
                <li>All medical services are given in good faith, and according to current best practice guidelines.
                    However, it must not be assumed that advice or treatment recommended by Doctor Today staff is the only
                    alternative available.</li>
                <li>You must reply honestly when asked for information by our doctors. Doctor Today Ltd is not responsible
                    if you withhold information or do not tell the truth.</li>
                <li>Doctor Today Ltd reserves the right to refuse to administer a treatment if a doctor or nurse deems it
                    inappropriate.</li>
                <li>It is our policy that a female chaperone is always present while female patients undergo intimate
                    examinations or tests by male clinicians. This chaperone may be one of the female reception staff when a
                    nurse is not available; alternatively you may bring along a family member or friend yourself. If this is
                    unacceptable to you, please ask to see a same-sex or female clinician when booking.</li>
                <li>Children under 16 years of age will not be seen unless accompanied by a parent or other person with
                    parental responsibility. However, with consent of both parties, a child under 16 may be seen privately
                    for non-intimate examinations by a same-sex or female clinician.</li>
                <li>Our in-house pharmacy provides dispensing facilities for patients seen by the doctor or the nurse. The
                    dispensary will not fill NHS prescriptions presented by members of the public. The cost of medication
                    must be met by the patient.</li>
                <li>Although most blood and laboratory test results are received within 24 hours, please be aware that
                    certain test results can only be disclosed subject to appropriate pre- and post-test counselling.</li>
                <li>Prices are subject to change without notice. However, cost of treatment will always be discussed with
                    the patient prior to commencement.</li>
                <li>Quotes for services may change if the patient's assumed diagnosis turns out to be different from or more
                    complicated than that originally quoted for.</li>
                <li>Doctor Today Ltd has a zero-tolerance policy with respect to the verbal or physical abuse of our staff,
                    or damage to our property. Offenders (together with appropriate supporting evidence) will be referred to
                    the police for prosecution.</li>
