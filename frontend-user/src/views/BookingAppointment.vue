        <p class="text-bae">Patients are welcome to attend with a family member or friend. At your specific request, 
        they may sit in on the consultation. For females undergoing intimate examinations or tests 
        by male clinicians, it is our policy that a female chaperone is always present, for your peace 
        of mind as well as ours so that probity is assured. This chaperone may be one of the female reception staff when a nurse 
        is not available; alternatively you may bring along a family member or friend yourself. If this is unacceptable 
        to you, please ask to see a same-sex or female clinician when booking.</p>

            female clinician.
