      We offer pre-booked appointments to everyone, irrespective of registration with an NHS doctor, private
      medical insurance or visitor status. Walk-in patients are welcome during our clinical hours, however booking an
      appointment is strongly recommended due to possible long waiting times as priority is given to booked
      appointments.
